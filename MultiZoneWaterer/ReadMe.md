##Solenoid and diode
Solder a 1N4007 diode between the the two terminals on the solenoid. The diode will have a white stripe on one end. It doesn't matter which terminal of the solenoid is closest to the white strip, but once you solder the diode to the solenoid terminals, or wires connected to the terminals, the terminal closest to the white stripe becomes the positive terminal of the solenoid. 

See this instructible for photos and more details on how to connect the diode to the solenoid, as well as other connections: https://www.instructables.com/Controling-a-solenoid-valve-with-an-Arduino/
